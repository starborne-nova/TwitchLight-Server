# TwitchLight-Server
Server component for a Chrome MV3 twitch notifier

## Usage
This is the server component to the TwitchLight template. A more in-depth setup guide is coming, but all Twitch developer variables have placeholders and the server is ready to be deployed through Heroku or another hosting service.

This is meant to be a easy starting point for people wanting to update or create a new twitch notification extension that works on MV3 and the Twitch Helix API. Due to the new constraints Twitch implemented, an external server is required to keep track of data since you can not anonymously query the Helix API
